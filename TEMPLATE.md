| **Automatic Smart Fish Tank Cleaner Using IoT**  | In our ongoing project, we are currently focused on developing an automatic smart fish tank cleaner. This endeavor addresses the challenges associated with maintaining large-scale fish tanks, particularly in fish agriculture settings. Equipped with mechanical components designed for efficient bottom cleaning and sensors for monitoring critical water parameters such as dissolved oxygen level, pH level, and Ammonia content, our system represents a significant advancement in aquaculture technology. Additionally, our project includes the development of a companion mobile application, which provides users with real-time updates on the cleaning process and access to sensor data. Through this project, we aim to revolutionize fish tank maintenance by offering a comprehensive and automated solution that ensures optimal water quality and fish health.                                            | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
